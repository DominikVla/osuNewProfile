# osu!NewProfile

This tool is mostly going to help players coming back from a break. It starts tracking your recently submitted scores and places them on a scoreboard, like the Best Performance scoreboard on your profile.

Using it is as simple as just typing in your user ID or username!
## Features
There aren't many features as this is meant to be a relatively simple tool. Here's a list of commands:
```
help - Shows commands in the application
show scores - Shows a table of scores (ALT: scores)
delete data - Deletes the userID and Saved Scores (ALT: delete)
quit - Closes the application
update - gets your most recent scores
```
## Usages
The application uses a few libraries.

[ossapi](https://tybug.github.io/ossapi/) - To interact with the osu! API.

[prettytable](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/) - To show the users scores.

[cx-Freeze](https://pypi.org/project/cx-Freeze/) - Used to convert python files to executables.
